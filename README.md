# SN1054 Bot

This is a Discord Bot for the Sn1054 Discord Server. (https:// discord (dot) gg/Sn1054)

It is based on the **discord.js** package.

It Runs in NodeJS and is hosted on a Raspberrypi 4.

I use a MongoDB Database because I some what know how it works.


***The Bot is updated when I am motivated to do so.***


The Features in it can be seen by typing .help in the Discord Chat

I am not a professional and this is only a hobby projekt.

env variables need to be configuired in docker-compose file

to not overflow the discord api I added caching to the .chtop command.
Because of that the caching process must be initiated every once in a while
